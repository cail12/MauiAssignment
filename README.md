App development Using C# and ,NET on MAUI Framework

Search for facts: The app can include a search function that allows users to search for specific facts by keyword or topic. The search function can use a database or web service to retrieve relevant facts based on the user's query.

Filter facts: The app can allow users to filter the list of facts by category or topic, making it easier to find facts on specific subjects.

Save favorite facts: The app can allow users to save their favorite facts for future reference. Users can add facts to a favorites list and access them later.

Share facts: The app can include sharing functionality that allows users to share interesting facts with their friends and family via social media, email, or text message.

Random fact generator: The app can include a random fact generator that displays a new, interesting fact each time the user opens the app or taps a button.

Daily facts: The app can provide a daily dose of interesting facts, sending users a notification each day with a new fact to read.
